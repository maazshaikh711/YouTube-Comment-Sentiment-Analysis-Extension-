### 📝 dvc.yaml
Defines the DVC pipeline, describing how data and models flow through the different stages of the project.
### 📄 dvc.lock
Locks the versions of the dependencies and ensures reproducibility across environments.

### 📝 params.yaml
This file contains the hyperparameters and settings for different stages of the machine learning pipeline. It includes data ingestion, feature extraction, and model building parameters.

### 📁 Scripts Directory

This directory contains various Python scripts used for testing, evaluating, and promoting machine learning models, as well as for testing the FastAPI backend using `pytest`.

- **1. load_model_test.py**: Tests the loading vectorizer machine learning model from model registry.
   
- **2. performance_test.py**: This script is typically used for assessing the accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score metrics for model evaluation.
   
- **3. promote_model.py**: Handles the model promotion process. This script is used to transition the model from staging phase to production. It ensures that the best-performing model is deployed.
   
- **4. fastapi_test.py**: Tests the FastAPI endpoints used for making predictions. This script ensures that the backend API is functional, and the model predictions are returned correctly.
   
Each of these scripts is critical for testing and deploying models and ensuring the API works correctly for real-time predictions.


### 📁 FastAPI Directory

This directory contains the FastAPI application and its dependencies used for serving machine learning model predictions via a backend API.

- **1. app.py**: The main FastAPI application file that defines the API endpoints. It handles incoming HTTP requests, loads the trained machine learning model, and serves predictions based on user inputs. The FastAPI app is used to expose model functionality to external services or users.

- **2. requirements.txt**: A text file that lists the dependencies required to run the FastAPI application. It includes libraries and tools such as FastAPI, Uvicorn, and any other necessary dependencies for the model serving functionality.
   
This directory is key for deploying the machine learning model as a service and interacting with it through HTTP requests.

### 🐳 Dockerfile
This `Dockerfile` defines a multi-stage build for creating a Docker image to deploy the FastAPI application with the machine learning model.Stages in the Dockerfile are:

- **1. Builder Stage**
   - **Base Image**: `python:3.10-slim`
   - **Purpose**: Sets up the environment for building the application by installing the necessary dependencies and libraries.

- **2. Runtime Image**
   - **Base Image**: `python:3.10-slim`
   - **Purpose**: The final image used to run the application, which is based on a slimmed-down Python image.

The use of a multi-stage build optimizes the Docker image by separating the build and runtime environments. The builder stage contains all the tools and dependencies needed to install libraries, while the runtime image only includes the essential libraries and application code, making the final image smaller and more efficient.

### ⚙️ **CICD Pipeline**
